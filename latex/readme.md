# Melba sample files.

This repo contains several compiled PDFs as example. They correspond to the different options of the melba.sty described in the melba-sample.tex:
- melba-sample-accepted-special-issue.pdf (corresponding to the `accepted` and `specialissue` options);
- melba-sample-accepted.pdf (`accepted` option only);
- melba-sample-arxiv-submission.pdf (`arxiv` option, it is meant to disable the line numbering to allow for an easy "clean" upload to arxiv);
- melba-sample-in-submission.pdf (corresponds to no option, this is the default and what should be used to submit a paper).
