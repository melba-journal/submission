# Melba sample files.

This repo contains several compiled PDFs as example. They correspond to the different options of the melba.cls described in the melba-sample.tex:
- melba-sample-arxiv-submission.pdf (`arxiv` option, it is meant to disable the line numbering to allow for an easy "clean" upload to arxiv);
- melba-sample-in-submission.pdf (corresponds to no option, this is the default and what should be used to submit a paper).

Other samples (accepted, special-issue) are disabled at the moment as the template is not meant for accepted/published papers yet
